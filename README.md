# Movie Gallery by SNL

Hello, you! 	:wave:

### What the project does:
We are so proud to show you our first ever movie gallery webpage, where we share movies we really like and recommend by creating a simple but nice website. 

### Why is the project useful?
For educational purpose, it is useful because this was made using HTML and CSS, and it was also created by a group: this was more like to learn how to work as a group, to communicate and agree on decisions for the website. 

### Who maintains and contributes to the project?
This project was made by me and my classmates. :cherry_blossom:
